# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the frontend.
The backend was started through a fork of a project file for phase-3 from Flatiron School.


## Goal of this project
The goal of this project is to create a custom API through Ruby to persist data and combine it with a frontend through React.

## Store-app
The app was setup to serve as a piece in the basic relationships between a store with an Etsy like structure where each store has its own products.
From each store, you can delete it, generate a new one or dig down further and see its product offerings. After products, you can see the reviews,
delete them, add a new one, or edit one that is currently there and the corresponding fetch request will send the data to the server.

The data currently stored on the server was seeded through the Faker gem.

## To get Started
CD into the store-app through the frontend folder and run `npm install`. After, run `npm start` to start up the front end. Open a new terminal, and
cd into the backend folder and run `bundle install`. After, run `bundle exec rake server` to run the backend server created with Ruby.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `bundle exec rake server`
Launches the backend server on (htt.://localhost:9292)

### `bundle exec rake console`
Runs binding.pry through rake for debugging

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
